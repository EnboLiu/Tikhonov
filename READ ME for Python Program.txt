For the python program. That is completely composed on my own. 

in order to run the python program, you should first make sure that Real_heart.mat; transfer matrix.mat; matlab.mat and Measured.mat
are already there. 

These three files can be generated by my Matlab Program. So if you want to load another set of data to run the Tikhonov regularization, you should first change the parameters in my matlab program and run it to output the corresponding mat files, copy that to the folder of Python program. And then run the python Tikhnov regularization with or without video output.

The tikhonov regularization is implemented by means of singular value decomposition in the python program. The efficiency of python program is relatively lower than the Matlab program. But they generally produce similar results.

When you see the 3D plot, the left hand side is the original data and you can see a clear wave front propagating the color is orange. On you right hand side is the estimation produced by the Tikhonov regularization. You will also see a clear wave front, color is pink, since the right hand side wave pattern is always very similar to the left hand side, you can see that the estimation is pretty reliable.

And more over, the changing number on the top the frame is the average error happened on each frame. That also help you get a general view of the precision of the estimation from tikhonov regularization.
